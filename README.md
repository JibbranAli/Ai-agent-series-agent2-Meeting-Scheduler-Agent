## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Basic Usage

#### Simple Calendar Agent
```python
from meeting_scheduler import CalendarAgent

# Create basic agent
agent = CalendarAgent()

# Schedule a meeting
result = agent.schedule_meeting(
    title="Team Meeting",
    participants="John, Sarah, Mike",
    start_time="2024-01-15 10:00",
    duration=60,
    location="Conference Room A"
)

print(f"Success: {result['success']}")
```

#### Advanced AI Agent
```python
from custom_ai_agent import ReasonableAgent, AgentMode

# Create advanced AI agent
ai_agent = ReasonableAgent(
    user_id="your_name",
    mode=AgentMode.AUTONOMOUS
)

# Autonomous scheduling
result = ai_agent.autonomous_schedule("Schedule a meeting with John next Tuesday")

print(f"AI Decision: {result.get('agent_action')}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.get('confidence', 0):.1%}")
```

### 3. Launch Advanced Interface
```python
from advanced_ai_ui import create_advanced_ai_ui
